This To-Do List is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The design is simple and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience. JavaScript handles task management dynamically, storing tasks in local storage so they persist even after refreshing the page. The CSS provides a clean and modern look, while HTML structures the list efficiently.
